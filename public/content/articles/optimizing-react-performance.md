# Optimizing React Performance

Make your React applications faster with these optimization techniques:

## Code Splitting

```jsx
const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));
```

## Memoization

```jsx
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(MyComponent);
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

## Virtual DOM Optimization

- Use keys properly
- Avoid inline functions
- Implement shouldComponentUpdate
