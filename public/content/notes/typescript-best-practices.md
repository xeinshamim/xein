# TypeScript Best Practices

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, making your code more robust and maintainable. Here are some best practices:

## Type Inference

Let TypeScript infer types when possible:

```typescript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]; // Type is inferred as number[]
```

## Interface vs Type

Use interfaces for object types and types for unions/intersections:

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

type Status = 'active' | 'inactive';
```
