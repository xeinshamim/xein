# Getting Started with the New React Hooks

React Hooks are a powerful feature that allows you to use state and other React features in functional components. Here's a quick guide to get started:

## useState Hook

The useState hook is used for managing state in functional components:

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

## useEffect Hook

useEffect is used for handling side effects:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = 'New Title';
}, []);
```

## Best Practices

1. Always name your custom hooks with 'use' prefix
2. Don't call hooks inside loops or conditions
3. Only call hooks from React function components
